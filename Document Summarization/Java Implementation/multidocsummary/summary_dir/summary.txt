Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba. 
Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night. 
The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico. 
``Right now it's actually moving over Jamaica,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation's southeastern coast as Gilbert's winds and rain began to brush the island.
