# Natural Language Processing

You will have an access to several applications of Natural Language Processing (Computational Linguistics) through this repo.
Currently it contains Java source code for document summarization. Document summarization is done in two steps: first single
document summarization and mutli document summarization. Multi Document Summarization is achieved by 
**Cover-Coeficient Based Multi Document Summarizer.** More useful code will be added in the future including heavily on
question answering. You can also find Azerbaijani translation of Text Summarization Lectures of **Dan Jurafsky.**
